    What is Lorem Ipsum?
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
    Lorem Ipsum.

    Why do we use it?
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
    layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
    using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
    page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
    sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
    purpose (injected humour and the like).

    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
    give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
    because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
    occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
    avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
